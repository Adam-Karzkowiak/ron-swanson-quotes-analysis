## General info
Application for analyzing Ron Swanson quotes using the Stanford coreNLP library.\
The project was created for a scientific purpose and allowed me to draw conclusions that should be obvious - Ron Swanson: 1, The Stanford NLP Group: 0.\
This genius cannot be analyzed.\
Application in progress - TODO: spring and REST, simple frontend, deployment (heroku).\
Kudos to jamesseanwright for creating ron-swanson-quotes which inspired me to create this (and allowed me to learn something new)\
All hail Ron Swanson.
