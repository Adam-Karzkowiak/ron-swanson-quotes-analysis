## General info
Application for analyzing Ron Swanson quotes using the Stanford coreNLP library.\
The project was created for a scientific purpose and allowed me to draw conclusions that should be obvious -\
Ron Swanson: 1, The Stanford NLP Group: 0.\
This genius cannot be analyzed.\
Application in progress - TODO: spring and REST, simple frontend, deployment (heroku).\
Kudos to [@jamesseanwright](https://github.com/jamesseanwright) for creating [ron-swanson-quotes](https://github.com/jamesseanwright/ron-swanson-quotes) which inspired me to create this (and allowed me to learn something new)\
